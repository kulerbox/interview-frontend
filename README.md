# Basic Tinder Web App

Create a very basic web application where a user can flip through images of a preselected gender with basic user information.

50 Random profiles have been generated by https://randomuser.me/ and have been assigned a random match.

Once a web user finds a match, show a notification to the user and have the option to view the profile or keep on matching.

When all profiles have been cycled through, show a placeholder to notify the user.
